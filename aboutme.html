			<h3>About Me:</h3>
			I choose the UW server as my platfrom to build my website because, its is one of the plateforms I have the most experience building websites on. I took CSE 154 and in the class for each assignemnt I would have to upload the website to the UW server. I also work for a small travel agency office as and IT consultant and Web Programmer. I transitioned their team's reservation system from and excel base process to and easy to use, up to date, online reservation system.

			I understand and I am fluent in mostly every web programming languages (php,javascript,html,css,etc) and hope to improve my skills in javascript and php. I hope to develop skills for making more dynamic websites with AJAX and DOM js. I can always be there to help anyone in INFO 102 with any help they need changing their website to fit any tastes they have. An academic goal for me is to major in informatics and/or economics here at UW and hoepfully get an MBA some day.
